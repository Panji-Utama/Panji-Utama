Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an undergraduate Software Engineering student at Telkom University. I have a passion for working out and diving into topics that pique my curiosity—especially those related to programming and software development.

## About Me

- 🎓 I am an undergraduate Software Engineering student at Telkom University.
- 💻 Aspiring to be a professional fullstack developer, currently more inclined towards Front-end Development.
- 🏋️‍♂️ I enjoy working out and staying fit.

## My Projects

- [Anti-Anxiety App](https://github.com/Panji-Utama/Anti-Anxiety_Mobile.ver): An mobile app where patients with anxiety could consult to both psychologist and psychiatrist.
